# Console07UI
Welcome to console 7 aka the best console!

Games include: Pachinko, TCT Game, Variable Friction, and Poolshot
 
# Pachinko
####
User controls an electromagnet on the top to drop a ball into the score buckets. Every time the user the user fails a ball should be pumped up by calling the playAgain() method in the scene. User can also choose level of difficulty between easy, medium and hard, varying the number of changes you get to score. Successfully implemented the Pachinko UI with the Hardware, as well as solved the issue with the LED blinking and double scoring by using specific delayed. 

# TCT (Table Cloth Trick)
####
Game is the rendition of the Table Cloth Trick, which demonstrates the laws of Inertia - an object in motion remains in motion unless a force acts upon it. User is able to click the start button to begin the demonstration - the cup is place on the yellow arm, starts moving and then is dropped into the second cup on the machine with the applied force of the arm. 

# Poolshot
###
User controls the yellow pump at the bottom to shoot a metal ball into the score buckets. Within the UI, the user is able to control the angle and direction of the pump with releaseBall() method, as well as being shown the amount of lives lost/remaining in the form of heart images. Also displayed on the screen is a live score. 

# Variable Friction
###
Based off of laws of physics, separate metal cubes race against different materials in order to demonstrate the varying forces of friction. Game is in progress as of 2017.
